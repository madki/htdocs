<h1>The Stupid fox</h1>
<p>“May be the grapes are sour”. </p>
<p>A perfect good way to defend oneself from hurtful feelings. Berate the grapes and move on. Normally that would have been my strategy too, but for once I chose differently. May be, it was the grapes themselves teasing me swaying in the wind, coming down, raising hopes, but yet staying just out of reach. So I decided to be the fox that would wait out for the grapes to ripe and fall. Jubilating at being clever, and feeling that I’ve bet fate I sit, hoping, looking, waiting. But alas destiny had different plans, days passed and the wine just crept taller taking the grapes higher, nor are they teasing me now, neither do they seem as intent at falling as they were. And yet I decided to wait it out, with increased hopes, and probably with blinded eyes and numbed logic. Then I saw the vine intricately weaving around the grapes holding them tighter, so even if they fall they’d still be in it’s hold, still out of my reach. And there I lay at last seeing the reality with teary eyes, lost in despair and yet hoping, deciding whether I should take up on the wine and drag it to earth. But am I that selfish? No, I am just a stupid fox who finally got over his inhibitions and got attached. Deep in the heart I know I won’t be able to venture this path ever again, so there I lay sitting, waiting, wailing and watching, knowing the ripe grapes would now rot, stuck in the strong hold of the vines.</p>
<p>I am the fox that hoped to beat the odds, all stories might not be like this. But sadly mine seems to be so. And there I lay still hoping for some miraculous whirlwind, watching, waiting…….</p>
