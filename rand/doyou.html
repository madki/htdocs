<h1>Do you see her?</h1>

<b>S</b>tunned to a stop on that marvelous night,<br>
<b>U</b>tterly spellbound by the presence ahead,<br>
<b>M</b>y mind trying to warp time, unwilling to depart,<br>
<b>E</b>ven when she was ushering me forward,<br>
<b>D</b>ulling all other senses to enhance my sight,<br>
<b>H</b>oping to hold the complete memory of the moment,<br>
<b>A</b>dmiring with obvious amazement, I see her.<br>
</p>
<p>	
<b>S</b>he was a breathtaking beauty,<br>
<b>Y</b>et with such simplicity.<br>
<b>A</b>nd I held my stare grounded,<br>
<b>M</b>otionless and astounded.
